# YouTube Homepage UI Clone 

A fully responsive **frontend clone** of the YouTube homepage created using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. This project replicates the structure and layout of YouTube’s interface, aiming to sharpen core frontend skills like **CSS styling, layout techniques**, and **responsive design**.

-A vertical sidebar with multiple navigation links
-A large video section with thumbnails, channel info, and view counts
-Organized file structure with separate folders for styles, icons, and images
-All elements are laid out using modern CSS features like Flexbox and CSS Grid.
